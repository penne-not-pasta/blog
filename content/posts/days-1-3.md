# Day #1

Day 1, I did nothing at all. I only opened up obsidian (my note taking app) and just stared at it for 30-ish minutes before closing it and going to my bed to crochet and watch youtube.

---

## Day 2-3

I did the same thing basically but I need to plan this out more if I actually want to learn Portuguese. So, I need a new plan.

---

## The Old & New Plan

this section is to map out my new & old plans to make my learning more efficent.

---

### The old plan:

The learning plan I didn't follow.

- Work on speaking & reading first.
- Study for no more than 2.5h a day.
- Take Breaks; to eat/drink whatnot.
- Practice Listening 3rd, and Writing/Typing 4th.
- Take notes as needed, dont be scared to ask questions (or for help.)

---

### The NEW plan:

- Join a community. (discord linked in [Relevant Links](#links) section)
- Be active in said community.
- Look for a language exchange partner.
- Take Notes **ON PAPER**.
- Ask questions.
- Use voice/video chats or livestreams to practice speaking.

## Conclusion

to be efficent i needed a new plan. So I made one and scrapped my old/original plans of this challenge. I plan to commit to the new/current plans and try my best to actually learn.

If I do not get to my original [Goal](https://penne.blog/posts/this-marks-my-100-day-journey/) I cannot be too disapointed because it was only for a fun challenge to motivate me.

Much love, & peace out my friends.
