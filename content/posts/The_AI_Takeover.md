# The AI TakeOver. My position on AI.

What goes the general populus think of when you say "AI is taking over!!"

They (or you), may think of generative AI taking everyones jobs, They (or you), may think of AI being a helpful tool, They (or you),, may think that AI should('nt) be used *No Matter What*. Today I'm gonna explain what AI is, how it's used today, the history and story of AI, and also my position and stance on AI.

Let's Go...

## What is AI?

AI, or Artificial inteligence In simple words, is about making computers smart enough to do things that usually require human intelligence, like learning from experience, solving problems, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions, often by analyzing huge amounts of data to find patterns instead of being programmed for *every single step*.

## A Brief History Lesson.

AI a.k.a Artifical Inteligence goes back to the 1720's belive it or not! Let's assemble a timeline then go through it.

### Pre 20'th Century:

- **1726**: Jonathan Swift's fantastic novel “Gulliver's Travels” introduces the idea of The Engine, a large mechanical contraption used to assist scholars in generating new ideas, sentences and books. 


### 1900–1950:

- **1914**: Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo demonstrates the first chess-playing machine, El Ajedrecista at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It used electromagnets and was fully automated. 
- **1921**: A play named "Rossum's Universal Robots" (R.U.R) opens in London. The play by Karel Čapek is the first time the word "robot" is used in English. 
- **1939**: John Vincent Atanasoff, a professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State College, and his graduate student Clifford Berry, create the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) with a grant of U$D 650 at Iowa State University.
    - While the ABC is never fully operational or widely used, it introduced several key concepts that would become foundational in the development of modern computing.
- **1943**: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics; It is one of the seminal works in the history of both neuroscience and AI.
- **1950**: British mathematician Alan Turing's landmark paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" is published in Mind. This paper is a foundational text in AI and addresses the question, "Can machines think?" 

### 1950-1980

- **1951**: Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmunds build the first artificial neural network. The Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator (SNARC) is an early attempt to model learning processes in the human brain, specifically through [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/reinforcement-learning).
- **1952**: Allen Newell, a mathematician and computer scientist, and Herbert A. Simon, a political scientist, develop influential programs such as the Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver
- **1955**: The term "artificial intelligence" is first coined in a workshop proposal titled "A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence," submitted by John McCarthy of Dartmouth College, Marvin Minsky of Harvard University, Nathaniel Rochester from IBM and Claude Shannon from Bell Telephone Laboratories.
    - The workshop, which took place a year later, in July and August 1956, is generally considered the official birthdate of the burgeoning field of AI.
- **1957**: Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist and computer scientist, develops the Perceptron, an early artificial neural network that enables pattern recognition based on a two-layer computer learning network.
