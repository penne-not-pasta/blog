# This Marks The Start of My 100 Day Journey

The rare 2 posts in 1 day for this blog. OK, So this will work by updating every 5 days starting on Thursday nov. 06, 2025, (*today*).

I am learning Brazillian Portuguese, and Mandarin Chinese, However i will be focusing on Portuguese this year since im less advanced in that language.
