# New Year, New Me.

As you guys have noticed I've ***completely*** wiped my blog, but dont worry, if i want the posts back I have copies of them Locally.

## New Years Resloutions.

As the topic of "New Years Resolutions" came up at home/in my family, It got me wondering what I wanted to change about myself this year. Obviously, I want to be a better person to myself and others, but what does that *really* mean? I quite simply dont know. (as of now of course.)

Heres a list of things I want to acomplish in 2026 / My new years resolutions.

- Be a better person, to myself and others.
- Finish 25 crochet projects.
- Finish 5 Knit Projects.
- Make my music taste more diverse.
- Do more school (as I am homeschooled.)
- Save up 400 bucks. (1k if i really want to.)
- Get that bike (+ accessories) for my birthday.

## More Yapping.

I'm just yapping now so if you want to ignore this you have my permission (not like you need it though lmfao.)

My next post will be on my stance about AI, so please LMK what I should talk about/cover in the comments of this post.
