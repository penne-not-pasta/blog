# Life Update 2.

hi everyone! sorry for not posting here. I have been *so* busy. I am quitting my job to get further self education to get a tech job of some kind.

I am also working on crochet, and other crafts. I'm also working with my therapist to try and better myself for the good. 

I am doimg quite a bit actually lmao. This post is my first of two today (11.26.2025).
