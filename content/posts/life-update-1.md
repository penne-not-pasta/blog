# Life Update #1

Happy Halloween everybody!! I hope it was great for you guys and gals. I'm excited to share some updates with y'all.

## Updates

- **New Blog Theme**: I've decided to switch to a new blog theme that I think will make the site look more modern and professional. It's still a work in progress, but I'm excited to see how it turns out! [Blog Theme Source](https://github.com/michaelneuper/hugo-texify3)
- **I Set Up My YT Channel**: I've set up my YouTube channel and started uploading videos. Check it out! [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@penne_not_pasta)

## My Discord Server was NUKED.

I have since set my server up again, but 4 months ago My discord was compromised, by multiple users, they were able to access my whole account, while i had access. They only managed to nuke my main server however since it was on my account i do not know who did it, i was on a plane at the time my server was nuked. Again I have set it up again. **IT IS PRIMARILY CODING FOCUSED**.
